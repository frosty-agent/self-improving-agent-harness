;;; Interactive / one-shot chat CLI helpers.
;;; Loaded via ASDF so reload_harness redefines these in a running chat image.
;;; scripts/chat.lisp only bootstraps env + calls RUN-CHAT-CLI.
;;;
;;; Hot-reload contract for interactive sessions:
;;; - RUN-INTERACTIVE stays a thin long-lived frame and only calls helpers by name.
;;; - Per-turn outcome formatting lives in src/chat-turn-report.lisp.
;;; - Sessions store OPTIONS/HANDLERS as function designators (symbols), not
;;;   captured function objects or frozen plists, so tool schemas and handlers
;;;   re-resolve after reload_harness without rebuilding the session.
